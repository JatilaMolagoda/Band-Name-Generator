# Band-Name-Generator
1st project of 100 projects in Python series.
Project breif.

The first step is to create a greeting for your program, in our case, it says "Welcome to the band

name generator."

And we print these messages using the print function.

So I'm going to say "Welcome to the band name generator."

And this when I run, it will just print that message.

Now, the next step is to ask the user for the city that they grew up in. So in order to get some input

from the user will need, of course, the input function.

And we're going to ask them using the prompt, which goes inside the parentheses: "Which Football club do you support?"

So now when I hit run, it's going to ask me for the favorite fotball club and I'm able to add a reply

like so.

Now, that data is just going to be lost to thin air unless I capture it and I give it a name, so I'm

going to have to create a variable to hold onto the data that the user inputted.

So we'll just call that "club" and then add the equal sign (=) to assign whatever it is that the user typed

in to this variable name.

And now I have access to the club variable and I can print it or use it later on if I want to, like so.

Now, the next step is to ask the user for the name of a pet.

So we'll call that variable "player" and we'll assign it the value that the user inputs for:

"What is the name of your favorite player?"

Now, step 4 is to combine the name of the club and the player and show them their band name.

Now, there's quite a few ways of doing this, especially if you look around on the Internet.

But the way that you learn in today's lessons is using string concatenation.

So we're going to do that.

So we're going to use a print statement and tell them "Your band name could be..."

And then we're going to add the name of the club and then add a space and then add the name of their

player.

So now when we run our code

it will ask us for the name of their club and then the name of a player, and then it should combine those

together and show us the name of our band.

Now, the final step is that the input cursor should show on a new line like this.

So here's the cursor.

But here's the input.

Just so that you get a bit of space and you're not typing it in directly after the prompt here like

what we have.

So how do we do that?

Well, you learned about modifying strings by creating a new line using the \n.

And we can add that both to the end of the club input and the player input.

And now when we run our code, you'll see that the cursor now shows up on the next line and our program

looks a lot better.

So there you have it.
